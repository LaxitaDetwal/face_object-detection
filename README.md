# face_object-detection
we have created a face detection and object detection in which the Face detection identifies human faces in images using machine learning techniques like Haar cascades or deep learning models. It involves converting images to grayscale, applying detection algorithms, and drawing bounding boxes around faces. Counting faces extends this by tallying detected faces.

Object detection identifies and locates multiple objects in images using algorithms like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN. The process includes image preprocessing, applying detection algorithms, and post-processing to refine results. These techniques are crucial in applications like security, crowd analysis, and autonomous driving, where identifying and locating objects or faces is essential.

- Libraries
    1. **OpenCV (`cv2`):**
        - **Purpose:** OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision tasks such as image and video processing, face detection, and object detection.
        - **Installation:**
            - **Windows/Linux/Mac:** `pip install opencv-python`
    2. **OS (`os`):**
        - **Purpose:** The `os` module is used to interact with the operating system, including tasks like navigating file directories and managing files.
        - **Installation:** Built-in library, no installation needed.
